Where did Espresso come from?
=============================

The original Espresso application was written at Berkeley in 1988 - 1989 and is available here:

* http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm

An updated version compatible with modern POSIXy systems is available from The University of Manchester:

* http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/tools/balsa/
* ftp://ftp.cs.man.ac.uk/pub/amulet/balsa/other-software

The updated version is used unmodified in this project to implement the logic minimization.
