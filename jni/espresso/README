This distribution is just a reworked version of the c. 1989 Berkeley
espresso source code.  All I've done is cut the number of files down
to just what is required for a modern POSIXy OS and made those files
more ISO-C compliant.  This should make building espresso a little
easier in these more standards compliant times.

See the file COPYING for the original code licence.  All kudos to the
original authors.
